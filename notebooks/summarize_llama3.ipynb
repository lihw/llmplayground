      "        beirut ( bayroot arabic romanized ) is the capital and largest city of lebanon. as of 2014 greater beirut has a population of 2.5 million which makes it the thirdlargest city in the levant region and the thirteenthlargest in the arab world. the city is situated on a peninsula at the midpoint of lebanons mediterranean coast. beirut has been inhabited for more than 5000 years making it one of the oldest cities in the world. beirut is lebanons seat of government and plays a central role in the lebanese economy with many banks and corporations based in the city. beirut is an important seaport for the country and region and rated a beta world city by the globalization and world cities research network. beirut was severely damaged by the lebanese civil war the 2006 lebanon war and the 2020 massive explosion in the port of beirut. its architectural and demographic structure underwent major change in recent decades. names the english name beirut is an early transcription of the arabic name bayrt (). the same names transcription into french is beyrouth which was sometimes used during lebanons french mandate. the arabic name derives from phoenician brt ( brt). this was a modification of the canaanite and phoenician word brt later brt meaning wells in reference to the sites accessible water table. the name is first attested in the 14th century bc when it was mentioned in three akkadian cuneiform tablets of the amarna letters letters sent by king ammunira of biruta to amenhotep iii or amenhotep iv of egypt. biruta was also mentioned in the amarna letters from king ribhadda of byblos. the greeks hellenised the name as bryts (ancient greek ) which the romans latinised as berytus. when it attained the status of a roman colony it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to colonia iulia augusta felix berytus to include its imperial sponsors. at the time of the crusades the city was known in french as barut or baruth. prehistory beirut was settled over 5000 years ago and there is evidence that the surrounding area had already been inhabited for tens of thousands of years prior to this. several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of beirut revealing flint tools from sequential periods dating from the middle palaeolithic and upper paleolithic through the neolithic to the bronze age. beirut i (minet elhosn) was listed as the town of beirut (french beyrouth ville) by louis burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the orient and bassoul hotels on the avenue des franais in central beirut. the site was discovered by lortet in 1894 and discussed by godefroy zumoffen in 1900. the flint industry from the site was described as mousterian and is held by the museum of fine arts of lyon. beirut ii (umm elkhatib) was suggested by burkhalter to have been south of tarik el jedideh where p.e. gigues discovered a copper age flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level. the site had been built on and destroyed by 1948. beirut iii (furn eshshebbak) listed as plateau tabet was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the beirut river. burkhalter suggested that it was west of the damascus road although this determination has been criticized by lorraine copeland. p. e. gigues discovered a series of neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle. auguste bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanization of the area. beirut iv (furn eshshebbak river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the furn esh shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. the area was covered in red sand that represented quaternary river terraces. the site was found by jesuit father dillenseger and published by fellow jesuits godefroy zumoffen raoul describes and auguste bergy. collections from the site were made by bergy describes and another jesuit paul\n",

      "        during the succeeding epoch of rebellion against ottoman hegemony in acre under jezzar pasha and abdullah pasha beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10000 and was an object of contention between the ottomans the local druze and the mamluks. after ibrahim pasha of egypt captured acre in 1832 beirut began its revival. after the albanian fighter tafil buzi was interned and then pardoned by the ottoman administration for his constant uprisings he raised 3000 albanian mercenaries to fight in lebanon some of them became notorious shortly afterwards for having been responsible for the widespread disorders in beirut. by the second half of the nineteenth century beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with european imperial powers particularly france. european interests in lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial center. this boom in crossregional trade allowed certain groups such as the sursock family to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened beiruts position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. meanwhile ottoman power in the region continued to decline. sectarian and religious conflicts power vacuums and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 lebanon conflict. beirut became a destination for maronite christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on mount lebanon and in damascus. this in turn altered the religious composition of beirut itself sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater lebanon. however beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. this was again a product of european intervention and also a general realization amongst the citys residents that commerce trade and prosperity depended on domestic stability. after petitions by the local bourgeois the governor of syria vilayet mehmed rashid pasha authorized the establishment of the beirut municipal council the first municipality established in the arab provinces of the empire. the council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades. vilayet of beirut in 1888 beirut was made capital of a vilayet (governorate) in syria including the sanjaks (prefectures) latakia tripoli beirut acre and bekaa. by this time beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with europe and the united states. it also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions such as the american university of beirut. provided with water from a british company and gas from a french one silk exports to europe came to dominate the local economy. after french engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across lebanon to damascus and aleppo in 1907 much of the trade was carried by french ships to marseille. french influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other european power. the 1911 encyclopdia britannica reported a population consisting of 36000 muslims 77000 christians 2500 jews 400 druze and 4100 foreigners. at the start of the 20th century salim ali salam was one of the most prominent figures in beirut holding numerous public positions including deputy from beirut to the ottoman parliament and president of the municipality of beirut. given his modern way of life the emergence of salim ali salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city. in his 2003 book entitled beirut and its seven families yussef bin ahmad bin ali al husseini says the seven families of beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the syrian coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of beirut and its shores and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it. modern era capital of lebanon after world war i and the collapse of the ottoman empire beirut along with the rest of lebanon was placed under the french mandate. lebanon achieved\n",
